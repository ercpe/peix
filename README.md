# peix

`peix` is a pure-python implementation of the [eix](https://github.com/vaeth/eix/) database format (https://github.com/vaeth/eix/blob/master/doc/eix-db.txt.in).
It can be used to read the eix database file or as a library to create own protocols based on the format. 

`peix` requires Python 3.4 or newer. It *may* work with previous versions of python, but it isn't supported.
